# Human Activity Recognition Project

This project classifies human activities (e.g., walking, sitting, running) using smartphone sensor data. It aims to provide accurate real-time activity detection that could be used in health monitoring, sports analytics, and various mobile applications.



## Introduction

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is an area of study focused on identifying physical activities performed by individuals based on data from sensors. In this project, we analyze data collected from smartphone sensors to accurately classify different physical activities.

## Features
- Real-time classification of activities based on sensor data.
- Visualization tools for activity patterns.
- Supports multiple sensor data formats (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope).
- Modular design for easy integration with mobile applications.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
